How to make thin pancakes with holes? Prepare everything you need for this. I use milk with 2% fat, and eggs of category C1. 
Sift the flour through a sieve in advance to saturate it with oxygen.
To prepare pancake dough, take a convenient deep bowl so that splashes do not fly out of it when kneading.
 Combine eggs with sugar and salt in a bowl. In a separate bowl, mix flour with baking soda.
Pour milk into the bowl with the eggs and, gradually adding flour and soda, knead the dough.
Then mix vegetable oil into the dough and add vinegar. Mix all ingredients well. To do this, you can use a mixer. 
The finished dough should be homogeneous, without lumps of flour. The pancake dough turns out to be quite liquid,
 which is exactly what it should be for thin pancakes. Let it stand for about 5 minutes. Vinegar reacts with soda in the
  dough - bubbles appear on the surface.
For frying, heat a pancake pan to a hot state and grease it with a thin layer of vegetable oil. To do this, you can use 
a napkin or a brush. The pan must be well heated. Quickly pour a little dough on it in a thin layer. These thin pancakes
 cook very quickly. Fry pancakes on both sides until golden brown.
Put the finished pancakes on top of each other on a separate plate and keep them under the lid so that they do not dry out.
Pancakes are obtained with a large number of holes. It is not convenient to wrap the filling in them, but dipping them in sour
 cream, condensed milk or jam will be delicious.
